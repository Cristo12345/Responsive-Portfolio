        <p>My name is Christian Suleiman. I am currently and undergraduate student at the City College of New York. I am
            rising senior pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree in the field of Computer Science. I am currently
            focusing on web development in hopes of entering the field upon graduation.</p>

        <p>Although my current focus is web development, I also have experience in object-orientated programming and
            algorithms. I have professional internship experience in broadcast engineering having interned at NBC Sports
            headquarters between 2017-2018. </p>

        <p>Born and raised in New York, I am seeking to advance my career in the Greater NYC area. My interests include
            graphic design, UX design, sports media, and traveling.
